Notes

key value is the same as previous assignment? Simple rest API?
A: yes

Does a shard store parts of the KVS? How to break up dictionary?
consitent hashing
Each dictionary is a subset of the main dictionary

What is a node with 2 shards? Two partitions of the data of that node?
2 copies of the subset dictionaries. 	

Adding a node to a shard? Does that mean spliting the dictionary?
Basically, another add another replica to the shard. No, does not mean splitting dictionary

Have a global view of replicas up right now. When someone goes offline or online. This will help with sharding. 
Shards are above replicas and the global view is above the sharding
