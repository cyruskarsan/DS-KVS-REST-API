Notes and design

key value is the same as previous assignment? Simple rest API?
A: yes

Does a shard store parts of the KVS? How to break up dictionary?
A: consitent hashing. Use this github library: https://github.com/ultrabug/uhashring
Each dictionary is a subset of the main dictionary

What is a node with 2 shards? Two partitions of the data of that node?
A: 2 copies of the subset dictionaries. 	

Adding a node to a shard? Does that mean spliting the dictionary?
A: Basically, another add another replica to the shard. No, does not mean splitting dictionary

Shards must have two nodes. This is the only requirement and all other nodes may be distributed however we please.

Layers: 
Global replica view is top layer
Shards are below global view
Nodes are apart of shards.
Shards are above replicas and the global view is above the sharding	

We must be able to provide:
1. ID of all shards in our program
2. ID of a shard given a node id (how do we know what node id is?)
3. Keys in a shard
4. Given shard number, provide shard id members (socket address of each node in the shard)

Resharding
gather all keys, rehash them, and then redistribute them

All containers will have the same shard count variable when first initialized
