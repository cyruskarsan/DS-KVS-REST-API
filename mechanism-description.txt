Nodes were assigned to shards using the SHARD_COUNT environment variable as well as the VIEW environ-
ment variable. Using a list to isolate each addresses of the nodes, we then assign it to a shared based
on the number of nodes and shards.

For resharding:
Collects all dictionaries from all different existing shards and gathers them in one master dictionary.
Reshards using the existing assignshards() class and redistributes keys.
