Nodes are organized into shards based on the initial number of shards given by the environment variable
SHARD_COUNT. You are free to choose any mechanism to create the shards. The only requirement is that
each shard must contain at least two nodes to provide fault tolerance. As an example, for a
key-value store with 6 nodes and shard count of 2, your implemented mechanism might put node1, node2,
and node3 into one shard and node4, node5, and node6 into the other shard. Or node1, node2, node3, and node4
can be the members of the first shard and node5, node6 can be in the second shard. You need to provide the
description of the mechanism you implemented in the mechanism-description.txt file.


 You can choose any resharding mechanism as long as it meets the
requirement of having at least two nodes in each shard. You must give a description of your resharding
mechanism in the mechanism-description.txt file.

You need to provide a description of the key-to-shard mapping strategy you implement in the
mechanism-description.txt file.
